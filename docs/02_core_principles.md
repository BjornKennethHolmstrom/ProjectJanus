# Core Principles of Project Janus

*The Foundational Assumptions and Methodological Commitments That Guide Our Work*

---

## Preamble

Project Janus rests on specific principles that distinguish it from other modeling approaches. These are not merely technical assumptions but represent our fundamental stance on what it means to be human and how to study human nature.

---

## 1. The Integration Principle

**"Human beings cannot be understood in isolation from any layer of their experience."**

### Commitments:
- We reject reductionism that explains higher-order phenomena solely through lower-level mechanisms
- We embrace emergent properties that arise from interactions between layers
- We model bidirectional causality (biology affects meaning, meaning affects biology)
- We acknowledge that fragmentation across disciplines has limited our understanding

### Implications:
- No domain is "more real" or foundational than others
- We must build bridges, not just deepen silos
- Explanations require showing mechanisms across multiple layers

---

## 2. The Meaning-Centric Principle

**"Meaning-making is not a peripheral human activity but the central organizing process of human experience."**

### Commitments:
- We treat the pursuit of meaning, purpose, and coherence as primary human drives
- We model humans as narrative beings who constantly interpret their experiences
- We take subjective experience as seriously as objective behavior
- We recognize that meaning crises can be more devastating than material lacks

### Implications:
- Models must account for why people act against pleasure/pain principles
- Success metrics include coherence and purpose, not just utility
- We must find ways to represent qualitative meaning experiences computationally

---

## 3. The Developmental Principle

**"Human beings are works in progress, not static entities."**

### Commitments:
- We model capacity for transformation across the lifespan
- We take developmental trajectories seriously (not just learning, but growth)
- We acknowledge that humans can qualitatively change how they process experience
- We incorporate the reality of regression, stagnation, and breakthrough

### Implications:
- Models must handle stage-like transitions, not just continuous learning
- We need to represent different ways of knowing, not just different knowledge
- Personal history matters as context for current state

---

## 4. The Multi-Methodology Principle

**"No single research method can capture the whole human being."**

### Commitments:
- We integrate quantitative and qualitative approaches
- We value first-person experience alongside third-person observation
- We bridge computational modeling with phenomenological inquiry
- We respect both scientific rigor and philosophical depth

### Implications:
- Validation requires multiple forms of evidence
- We need both mathematical precision and narrative richness
- Different questions require different methodological tools

---

## 5. The Practical Wisdom Principle

**"Understanding should serve flourishing."**

### Commitments:
- Knowledge should ultimately help humans live better lives
- We prioritize research directions with practical implications
- We maintain connection between theoretical models and human suffering/joy
- We consider ethical implications at every stage

### Implications:
- Applications to mental health, education, and AI ethics guide our priorities
- We regularly ask "so what?" and "who benefits?"
- We consider both individual and collective flourishing

---

## 6. The Complexity Principle

**"Human systems are complex, not just complicated."**

### Commitments:
- We expect non-linear dynamics and emergent properties
- We acknowledge the limits of prediction in complex systems
- We model feedback loops and recursive processes
- We embrace necessary uncertainty and ambiguity

### Implications:
- Simple causal models are insufficient
- We need sensitivity to initial conditions and path dependence
- Some phenomena may be understandable but not predictable

---

## 7. The Values-Explicit Principle

**"We make our value commitments transparent rather than pretending to be value-neutral."**

### Commitments:
- We acknowledge that modeling choices reflect value judgments
- We state our ethical commitments explicitly
- We recognize that all science has philosophical foundations
- We maintain reflexivity about our own biases and assumptions

### Implications:
- Documentation includes rationale for modeling choices
- We regularly examine our own blind spots
- We welcome critique of our foundational assumptions

---

## 8. The Humility Principle

**"Our models are maps, not territories."**

### Commitments:
- We acknowledge the profound mystery of human consciousness
- We recognize that any model will be incomplete
- We maintain openness to surprise and contradiction
- We balance confidence in our approach with awareness of its limitations

### Implications:
- We avoid claiming final or complete explanations
- We build in capacity for model revision and updating
- We respect phenomena that challenge our current frameworks

---

## Methodological Applications

### Modeling Standards
- All components must specify their cross-domain interfaces
- Models should be able to represent developmental change
- Systems must handle value conflicts and meaning crises
- Implementations should have clear paths to practical application

### Research Priorities
- Questions that bridge multiple domains take precedence
- Projects with implications for human flourishing get priority
- We favor approaches that respect complexity over simplistic solutions
- We balance technical feasibility with conceptual ambition

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Explanatory power**: Can it handle paradoxes and contradictions?
- **Practical utility**: Does it help real people?
- **Conceptual coherence**: Does it integrate well with other domains?
- **Ethical alignment**: Does it promote human dignity and flourishing?

## Living Principles

These principles will evolve as our understanding deepens. They serve as our guiding stars, not immutable laws. We commit to regularly revisiting and refining them as we learn.

*"We have to remember that what we observe is not nature herself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning."* — Werner Heisenberg

*Project Janus is as much about refining our questions as finding answers.*
