# Project Janus Glossary

*Common Definitions Across Disciplinary Boundaries*

---

## Purpose
This glossary establishes shared definitions for terms that may have different meanings across psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, computer science, and spirituality. The goal is precision without losing the richness of human experience.

---

## Core Concepts

### A
**Agency**  
*The capacity to act intentionally with awareness of choice.* Distinguished from mere behavior by conscious direction and potential for reflection.

**Alignment (Values-Behavior)**  
*The degree of coherence between one's stated values and actual behaviors.* Misalignment creates cognitive dissonance and existential distress.

### B
**Biological Layer**  
*The physical substrate of human experience:* neurochemistry, physiology, genetics, and bodily systems.

### C
**Cognitive Layer**  
*Mental processes of reasoning, memory, attention, and belief formation.* Includes both conscious and unconscious processing.

**Coherence (Psychological)**  
*The experience of internal consistency across beliefs, values, emotions, and actions.* A fundamental human drive.

### D
**Developmental Trajectory**  
*The pattern of growth and change across the lifespan.* Not merely aging, but qualitative transformations in perspective and capacity.

### E
**Emotional Layer**  
*The system of affective responses, moods, and feeling states that color experience and motivate action.*

**Existential Layer**  
*The dimension of human experience concerned with meaning, purpose, mortality, and freedom.*

### F
**Framework (Janus)**  
*Our integrated model connecting six layers of human experience through dynamic feedback loops.*

### I
**Integration**  
*The process of bringing disparate parts into harmonious relationship.* In psychology: making the unconscious conscious. In systems: creating functional wholes from separate components.

### M
**Meaning-Making**  
*The fundamental human process of interpreting experiences through narrative frameworks that provide coherence and purpose.* The central engine of Project Janus.

**Multi-Layered Modeling**  
*Our approach of simulating human experience across biological, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, social, and existential dimensions simultaneously.*

### N
**Narrative Identity**  
*The evolving story one constructs about who one is, how one came to be, and where one's life is going.*

### S
**Self-Transcendence**  
*The capacity to go beyond self-centered concerns to connect with larger values, purposes, or beings.*

**Social Layer**  
*The dimension of human experience involving relationships, cultural norms, group identities, and interpersonal dynamics.*

**Spiritual Layer**  
*The aspect of human experience concerned with connection to something larger than the individual self, whether conceived as divine, cosmic, or deeply humanistic.*

### V
**Values**  
*Deeply held principles that guide behavior and provide standards for evaluation.* Distinguished from preferences by their enduring nature and central role in identity.

## Domain-Specific Clarifications

### Psychology vs. Computer Science
**"Model"**  
- *Psychology:* A theoretical framework explaining human behavior  
- *Computer Science:* A computational representation that can simulate behavior  
- *Janus Usage:* Both—we build computational models of psychological models

### Neuroscience vs. Philosophy  
**"Self"**  
- *Neuroscience:* The experience of continuous identity emerging from neural processes  
- *Philosophy:* The subjective center of experience and agency  
- *Janus Usage:* The recursively updated narrative identity that emerges from but transcends biological processes

### Biology vs. Spirituality
**"Human Nature"**  
- *Biology:* The genetic and evolutionary endowment of Homo sapiens  
- *Spirituality:* The essential qualities and potential of human consciousness  
- *Janus Usage:* The dynamic interaction between biological constraints and spiritual aspirations

## Key Distinctions

### Meaning vs. Happiness
- **Meaning**: Arises from coherence, purpose, and significance  
- **Happiness**: Arises from pleasure, satisfaction, and positive affect  
*One can have meaning without happiness, and happiness without meaning.*

### Values vs. Preferences
- **Values**: Enduring, identity-constituting, provide life direction  
- **Preferences**: Transient, context-dependent, concern specific objects  
*Values are what you're willing to suffer for.*

### Integration vs. Repression
- **Integration**: Acknowledging and working with all aspects of self  
- **Repression**: Denying or avoiding uncomfortable aspects  
*Integration leads to wholeness; repression leads to fragmentation.*

### Self-Transcendence vs. Self-Abandonment  
- **Self-Transcendence**: Going beyond ego concerns while maintaining healthy selfhood  
- **Self-Abandonment**: Losing oneself in others or causes  
*Transcendence requires a solid self to transcend.*

## Emerging Janus-Specific Terms

**Janus Bridge**  
*The conceptual and computational interfaces between different layers of human experience.*

**Meaning Crisis**  
*The experience of collapse in one's narrative framework, leading to disorientation and loss of purpose.*

**Multi-Layered Conflict**  
*Tension arising when different layers of human experience pull in opposing directions (e.g., biological drives vs. spiritual values).*

**Recursive Self-Modeling**  
*The human capacity to create and continuously update models of ourselves.*

**Values-Behavior Gap**  
*The space between conscious values and actual behavior—a primary source of human suffering.*
