# Project Janus

*An Integrated Framework for Modeling Human Nature Across Biological, Cognitive, Emotional, Social, and Existential Dimensions*

---

## Vision

**Project Janus** aims to develop the first comprehensive computational framework that models human beings as integrated wholes—not just as biological organisms, cognitive processors, or social actors, but as meaning-making beings who constantly navigate the space between our biological constraints and spiritual aspirations.

Traditional models of human nature have been fragmented across disciplines: psychology studies the mind, biology studies the body, sociology studies groups, and philosophy studies meaning—but humans experience all these dimensions simultaneously. Project Janus bridges these divides.

## The Challenge We Address

Current models fail to explain why:
- People with every material advantage can experience profound emptiness
- Individuals in terrible conditions can find deep meaning and resilience  
- Smart people believe contradictory things
- Personal transformation happens across the lifespan
- We consistently act against our own stated values

## Core Principles

1. **Multi-Layered Integration**: Humans operate across biological, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, social, and existential layers simultaneously
2. **Dynamic Meaning-Making**: The pursuit of coherence and purpose drives behavior as much as pleasure or utility maximization
3. **Recursive Self-Modeling**: Humans constantly update their self-narratives based on experience
4. **Values-Behavior Alignment**: Suffering often arises from misalignment between actions and deeply held values

## Current Focus Areas

- **Meaning-Making Mechanisms**: How humans construct and maintain life narratives
- **Values-Behavior Alignment**: Modeling the gap between intentions and actions
- **Multi-Layered Conflict Resolution**: How humans resolve tensions between biological drives and higher values
- **Developmental Trajectories**: Modeling personal growth across the lifespan
