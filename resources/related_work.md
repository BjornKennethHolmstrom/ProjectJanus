## Gaps in Existing Work

### Domain Integration
Most approaches focus on single domains (cognition, emotion, biology) without adequate integration across all aspects of human experience.

### Developmental Dynamics
Few computational models incorporate stage-like developmental transitions or the evolution of meaning-making systems.

### Meaning and Purpose
Most psychological models underemphasize the central role of meaning-making and purpose in human functioning.

### Wisdom and Ethics
Computational approaches rarely address wisdom development or ethical growth as central concerns.

### Whole Person Modeling
The field lacks comprehensive models that integrate biological, psychological, social, and existential dimensions.

## Unique Contributions of Project Janus

## Conclusion

Project Janus stands on the shoulders of giants across multiple disciplines. By integrating insights from cognitive science, developmental psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and complex systems, we aim to create a more comprehensive understanding of human nature.

Our unique contribution lies not in discovering new fundamental principles, but in weaving together existing knowledge into an integrated framework that can be computationally implemented and practically applied. We honor the depth and specificity of each disciplinary approach while seeking the connections and patterns that emerge when we consider the whole human being.

This related work review serves as both acknowledgment of our intellectual debts and mapping of the territory we seek to navigate. As Project Janus evolves, we remain committed to ongoing dialogue with these traditions and to contributing our own insights back to the broader human conversation about who we are and who we might become.
